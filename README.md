# String Master

Android application I am working on for my senior project.

String Master will be an Android app with the main function of teaching a user where notes are located on the fretboard of a guitar. This will be accomplished through a ‘trainer’ activity which will show random notes available on a selected string, which the user must find and play. If the note is recognized by the app as matching the desired note, the user will be notified and another note will be provided to find. Metrics such as notes correct and time to find notes can show progress. A guitar tuner will also be provided.

# Current Status

The app currently runs and has a navigation drawer with two fragments. One fragment is empty, while the other has a basic guitar tuner. The tuner currently listens for sound, converts it to MIDI notes, and displays how close the dominant pitch is to the nearest guitar string pitch.
